                    <h1>Composition</h1>

                    <p>
                        Bruce Reiprich's music has been described as having "unapologetic lushness" (NewMusicBox), as "post-romantic radiance" (<i>Danbury News-Times</i>),
                        "a contemplative mood, its sedate pace subtly dilating the flow of time" (<i>Eagle Rock Patch</i>), "a deeply personal mediation on the poet's feelings"
                        (<i>San Francisco Classical Voice</i>), "very powerful" (<i>All Music Guide</i>), "lovely and evocative" (<i>Guitar Review-New York</i>), "very impressive"
                        (<i>Cumhuriyet</i>-Turkey), and "of special interest" (<i>Guitar International</i>-England). With compositions that span the gamut from overt tonality and
                        metric regularity to atonality and pronounced rhythmic flexibility, he explores the beauty of lyrical lines, lush harmonies and colorful textures. Composers
                        as diverse as Toru Takemitsu, Pierre Boulez, György Ligeti, Luigi Nono and Samuel Barber have been particularly influential in the development of his own style.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Much of Reiprich's music is a reflection upon images of nature found in the Turkish poetry of Oguz Tansel and in classical Chinese and Japanese poetry.
                        Recently, he has been influenced by the long sentences with spiraling subordinate clauses that Marcel Proust employed in his <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>,
                        as well as the long, rhapsodic sentences of L&aacute;szl&oacute; Krasznahorkai, Claude Simon and Mircea Cărtărescu. Ultimately, it is the serene and
                        contemplative-the unexpected moment of self-contained and quiescent beauty in nature and art-that serve as Reiprich's inspiration.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Artistic/Creative Work" award for 2016. He was a fellow at the <a target="_blank" class="textlink" href="http://www.vcca.com">Virginia Center for the Creative Arts</a>
