          <h1><em>Lullaby</em> for violin and orchestra</h1>

          <div>
            <p class="reviewcomment">
              &quot;At six minutes, Bruce Reiprich's harmonically lush <i>Lullaby</i> is the recording's shortest setting, but its brevity makes it no less affecting, especially when
              Goran Koncar's the violinist involved. Composed in 2002 to celebrate the birth of a friend's child, the piece is suitably lyrical, with the composer evoking
              the wonder of new birth in the writing's uplifting spirit and stirring coda. All five of the recording's dynamic works have much to recommend them on formal
              grounds, but it's their emotional effects, so powerfully instantiated by Reiprich's piece, that register as memorably.&quot;

              &quot;Bruce Reiprich's 'Lullaby', written upon the birth of a friend’s child, is a harmonically lush composition for violin solo and orchestra. Tender and sentimental,
              the piece reflects on the wonder of new life and the love that comes as people gather to help a child grow.&quot;

              &quot;Navona Records deliver a wonderfully balanced compilation album. These five compositions offer up incredibly deep and multilayered works which flow naturally together.
              It's hard to single out highlights, but Bruce Reiprich’s 'Lullaby' really stuck with me.&quot;

              &quot;Bruce Reiprich’s brief <i>Lullaby</i> (2002/2018) was written to celebrate the birth of a friend’s son. It is a lush and romantic work beautifully performed
              here by Goran Končar in what would make for a really gorgeous encore number.&quot;

              &quot;<i>Lullaby</i> by Bruce Reiprich celebrates the birth of a child—the new son of a violinist friend. Hence the violin is the solo instrument here. It reflects
              tenderness, joy and wonder, after a brief but weighty introduction. Goran Končar, the soloist on this recording, has a lovely warm and sympathetic sound which
              portrays this superbly.&quot;

              &quot;Written for John Masserini and Jonathan Bergeron, Bruce Reiprich’s <i>A Necklace of Dew</i> employs effects pedals to generate hip distorted sounds, allowing
              the duo to create thicker textures and to reach outside of their previous sound palate. The gestural figures combine to play the two off of each other, and
              the pedals to build large stacked harmony behind the oscillating lines, juxtaposing this against the distorted sounds. The variety and grittiness of this track
              compared to the previous tracks allows the album as a whole to open up again.&quot;

              &quot;Bruce Reiprich&apos;s refreshing <em>Flowing Waters Caress Fallen Petal</em> (2010) . . . set a contemplative mood, its sedate pace subtly dilating the flow of
              time in Branson Auditorium. The work&apos;s generally meditative atmosphere was balanced by frequent interruption of cascading, water-like sonorities that
              cleansed the senses.&quot;

              &quot;For a finale, Diaz, Bob, and cellist Jing Li played Bruce Reiprich&apos;s Chozubachi, a Takemitsu homage that evoked that composer&apos;s most cinematic, Messiaen-jazz moods
              with unapologetic lushness.&quot;

              &quot;Bruce Reiprich&apos;s Weeping Willow (1990) sets a poem in Turkish by poet Oguz Tansel, a recently deceased friend of the
              composer&apos;s. Scored for soprano and string quartet, its slow, stepwise motion and low register offer a deeply personal
              meditation on the poet&apos;s feelings and their embodiment in nature, represented by the willow tree. The music&apos;s simple,
              unselfconscious minimalism conveys the text&apos;s meaning with directness and genuine empathy.&quot;

              &quot;Bruce Reiprich&apos;s Dusk uses complex chords evolving slowly to illustrate the changing colors accompanying the end of
              the day. Very powerful, it stands out as the CD’s highlight.&quot;

              &quot;This piece has been composed with the density of post-romanticism and occasional use of the twelve-tone technique. Following the pastoral
              medium created by a long instrumental introduction, the entrance of the choir is very impressive.&quot;
