          <h1><em>Flowing Waters Caresss Fallen Petal</em> for piano</h1>

            <p class="reviewcomment">
              &quot;Bruce Reiprich&apos;s refreshing <em>Flowing Waters Caress Fallen Petal</em> (2010) . . . set a contemplative mood, its sedate pace subtly dilating the flow of
              time in Branson Auditorium. The work&apos;s generally meditative atmosphere was balanced by frequent interruption of cascading, water-like sonorities that
              cleansed the senses.&quot;

              &quot;For a finale, Diaz, Bob, and cellist Jing Li played Bruce Reiprich&apos;s Chozubachi, a Takemitsu homage that evoked that composer&apos;s most cinematic, Messiaen-jazz moods
              with unapologetic lushness.&quot;

            &quot;An anthropomorphic evocation via shimmering clusters of tone and orchestral color that added up to a postromantic radiance.&quot;

          <h1><em>Weeping Willow</em> for soprano and string quartet</h1>

          <div>
            <p class="reviewcomment">
              &quot;Bruce Reiprich&apos;s Weeping Willow (1990) sets a poem in Turkish by poet Oguz Tansel, a recently deceased friend of the
              composer&apos;s. Scored for soprano and string quartet, its slow, stepwise motion and low register offer a deeply personal
              meditation on the poet&apos;s feelings and their embodiment in nature, represented by the willow tree. The music&apos;s simple,
              unselfconscious minimalism conveys the text&apos;s meaning with directness and genuine empathy.&quot;

            <p class="reviewcomment">
              &quot;Bruce Reiprich&apos;s Dusk uses complex chords evolving slowly to illustrate the changing colors accompanying the end of
              the day. Very powerful, it stands out as the CDâ€™s highlight.&quot;

          <div>
            <p class="reviewcomment">
              &quot;This piece has been composed with the density of post-romanticism and occasional use of the twelve-tone technique. Following the pastoral
              medium created by a long instrumental introduction, the entrance of the choir is very impressive.&quot;
